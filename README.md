I was not able to upload my code entirely due to the restriction on the number of codes that I can upload once.
Therefore I uploaded only a core part.
The entire code can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y88kMpEhnxZquPTuLaVzoP6IKZeGtyQX?usp=share_link.
<br><br>
The code is designed to work with OpenAI Gym environment and stable_baselines3 library.<br>
Please install OpenAI Gym environment and stable_baselines3 on your computer first and then run this software.
<br><br>
For more details about the algorithm, please read the following article:<br>
*T. Tanaka, H. Malki, Deep Learning Approach to Planetary Rover Path Planning Under Static and Dynamic Constraints. (under review, a link will be added once pulished)
<br><br>
Note: This code was developed based on an open-source code *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment (MiniGrid)* (https://github.com/mit-acl/gym-minigrid). Please also cite this website when you use this code in public.<br>

Thanks!ã€€<br>
