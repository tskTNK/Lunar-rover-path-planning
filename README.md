This is a grid world-based lunar surface environment used for my path planning search study *T. Tanaka, H. Malki, Deep Learning Approach to Planetary Rover Path Planning Under Static and Dynamic Constraints. (under review, a link will be added once pulished)
<br><br>
The code here only contains a training environment and does not include a learning agent.<br>
Please install stable_baselines3 on your computer to run this software at your environement.
<br><br>
The entire code including a learning agent can be provided at request.

Note: This code was developed based on an open-source code *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment (MiniGrid)* (https://github.com/mit-acl/gym-minigrid). Please also cite this website when you use this code in public.<br>
